    content: "寫程式就像蓋房子，專案的資料夾架構就是地基。有些簡潔明瞭，但難以擴充；有些複雜到像迷宮，自己都會迷路。我一直在找一種「能長大但不亂套」的架構方式。清楚的分類能讓團隊協作更順利、維護更輕鬆，也讓未來的自己少一點髮量損失。架構好壞，寫的當下看不出來，但半年後就會真相大白。#軟體工程 #資料夾架構",

    content: "Writing code is like building a house—the folder structure is your foundation. Some setups are simple but rigid, others are so over-architected they become haunted mansions of complexity. I’m always chasing a folder structure that can grow without turning into chaos. A clear, scalable layout helps teams collaborate, makes maintenance bearable, and saves Future Me from unnecessary hair loss. You won’t notice the cost of bad structure immediately, but give it six months—it’ll show. #SoftwareEngineering #FolderStructure",
